            <h4 class="cmd-middle-text-area-title">About CheckMyDeposit</h4>
            CheckMyDeposit is a trading name of FairPlane UK Limited. We are a firm of solicitors dealing exclusively with consumer rights, including tenancy deposit claims.
            <br/><br/><h4 class="cmd-middle-text-area-title">Our service</h4>
            CheckMyDeposit assists tenants in making compensation claims against landlords who have failed to protect their deposits according to the law.
            <br/><br/> All tenants who rent flats or houses and have paid a rental deposit are protected under the Government Tenancy Deposit scheme. This means that landlords are required to register rental deposits paid to them with one of three Government tenancy deposit schemes. The landlord is required to provide the tenant with a certificate confirming that the deposit was registered correctly.
            <br/><br/> Failure to register a deposit and/or provide the required information to the tenant within 30 days of the deposit being made, entitles the tenant to receive compensation between one and three times the deposit sum originally paid.
            <br/><br/> Claims can be made up to 6 years after the date the deposit was paid, as the rule applies to both current and old tenancies.
            <br/><br/> Even if a tenant received all of their deposit back at the end of their tenancy, they are still entitled to make a claim for compensation if their deposit wasn’t correctly protected.
            <br/><br/><h4 class="cmd-middle-text-area-title">Our affiliate partner programme</h4>
            Our affiliate partner programme is just one of the methods we are using to draw attention to the issue of unsecured tenancy deposits.
            <br/><br/> We are looking for people who are able to introduce us to tenants who have potential claims and are happy to work with us and allow us to represent them in regards to making their claim.
            <br/><br/> For every client that you introduce to us, who then goes on to make a successful claim, we will pay you a fee.
            <br/><br/> Fees paid depend on the final amount of the successful claim and the amount of claimants delivered over an agreed time period. Please contact us to discuss the potential fees on offer before registering.
            <br/><br/> Call Sarah Payne on <strong>0203 074 1100</strong> or email <a href="mailto:sarah@fairplane.co.uk.">sarah@fairplane.co.uk.</a>
